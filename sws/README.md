SWS Sandbox
=================

This is my playground for testing out the SWS repo, and playing with it's implementation.


# Taken from: Simple-Web-Server 
[https://github.com/eidheim/Simple-Web-Server][1]

[1]: https://github.com/eidheim/Simple-Web-Server


A very simple, fast, multithreaded, platform independent HTTP and HTTPS server and client library implemented using C++11 and Boost.Asio. Created to be an easy way to make REST resources available from C++ applications. 

See https://github.com/eidheim/Simple-WebSocket-Server for an easy way to make WebSocket/WebSocket Secure endpoints in C++. Also, feel free to check out the new C++ IDE supporting C++11/14/17: https://github.com/cppit/jucipp.
